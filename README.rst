====================
XSnippet Web Backend
====================

XSnippet is a simple web-service for sharing code snippets on the Internet.
Years ago it was started as educational project, and nothing changed since
then. That's why the fourth reincarnation is written in Python using
``asyncio``.

xsnippet-web-backend is a web-service, that is meant to be deployed alongside
the xsnippet-web SPA and helps to implement the features, which can't be
implemented purely on the client side (e.g. "raw" content of the snippets
served as plain text over HTTP or "embed" mode, etc).

sending us pull requests or patches. Your feedback is welcome as well!
